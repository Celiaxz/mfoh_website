        <h1>Partnership with Human Rights Commission</h1>
        Sequel to discussions during a courtesy/advocacy visit to the Executive
        Secretary of the National Human Rights on 14th December 2022, the idea
        to collaborate in advancing and effectively consolidating the respect
        and enjoyment of human rights in Nigeria was hatched. Consequent upon a
        series of engagements with the Commission, the proposed partnership
        attained a new height evidenced by a strategic meeting with the Director
        overseeing the Human Rights Institute; Mr. Obinna Nwakonye, and MFOH
        Nigeriaâ€™s Ambassador; Queen Rita Chika Ezenwa in Abuja for proper Human
        Rights exchange programmes.
